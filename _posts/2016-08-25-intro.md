In this first post, I talk about what I wish to achieve through these blog post

## Why makes this blog
-----

Through this blog, I want to share my experiences and insight into different tools I work with everyday. I think most of the content will focus on math concepts, programming insights or some productivity tool that I found interesting.

I realize that blogging is self promotion to a certain extend - I am not sure if this is something I need to embrace or be weary of. 
Additioanlly, this is my first attempyt at blogging so I realize it may be a while before I land on what works. I do appreciate you visiting my blog and being patient while I figure this out. I would really like to hear back at blog@rohanbali.com with any suggestions or comments (or just say hey)
